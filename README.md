## Analysis of the Shanghai repos dataset with users having more than 200 followers:

- **Data Scraping Explanation**  
  Used GitHub API to scrape profiles of users in Shanghai with 200+ followers. Cleaned data using Pandas and sklearn, imputing "NaN" values and standardizing booleans to lowercase.

- **Interesting & Suprising Findings**  
  Niche languages (e.g., Rich Text) attracted more followers; users without bios had higher average followers; follower count seemed independent of "hireable" status.

- **Developer Recommendations**  
  Using popular languages like Python/JavaScript can increase stargazers and community reach. Adding licenses would promote reusability, transparency, and legal clarity across repositories.
